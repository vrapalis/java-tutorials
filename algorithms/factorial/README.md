# Factorial Algorithm

---

> In mathematics, the **factorial** of a **non-negative** integer n, 
> denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example, 
> the factorial of 5 (written as 5!) is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120. The factorial of 0 (written as 0!) is defined to be 1.
> **The big O** of the **recursive** and **iterative** factorial algorithms that I described above is O(n), 
> because the running time of both algorithms increases **linearly** with the input size. 
> This means that if the input size is doubled, the running time of the algorithm will also be roughly doubled.
